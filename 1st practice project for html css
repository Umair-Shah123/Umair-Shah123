          Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, fondly known as the
          <strong><mark id="mark">"Missile Man of India,"</mark></strong>
          was a visionary scientist and the 11th President of India, serving
          from 2002 to 2007. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil
          Nadu, he rose from humble beginnings to become one of the most
          respected figures in Indian history. Kalam's contributions to the
          Indian space and missile programs are monumental. He played a pivotal
          role in the development of India's first indigenous Satellite Launch
          Vehicle (SLV-III), which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in
          1980, and was instrumental in the development of the Agni and Prithvi
          missiles. Beyond his scientific achievements, Dr. Kalam was an
          inspiring leader and educator, dedicating his life to igniting young
          minds and promoting education and innovation. He authored several
          books, including the best-selling autobiography
          <strong>"Wings of Fire," </strong>which continues to inspire millions
          across the globe. Known for his humility, simplicity, and unyielding
          commitment to public service, Dr. Kalam's legacy endures through his
          profound impact on science, education, and the aspirations of a
          nation. His vision for India as a developed nation, encapsulated in
          his book <strong>"India 2020,"</strong> remains a guiding light for
          future generations. Dr. Kalam passed away on July 27, 2015, while
          delivering a lecture, leaving behind a legacy of dreams, achievements,
          and an indomitable spirit.
